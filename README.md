All Jupyter Notebooks used in the workshops, whether follow-along `.ipynb` files or the game implementation ones, should be in this directory.

## [Lesson-Plans](/Lesson-Plans/)
This directory contains the lesson plans for the 2 days.

## [Notes](/Notes/)
All the workshop notes will be in this directory. Those marked with `-handout` are for distribution to students, and those without are for teaching use.

Note: All files starting with `lesson` are no longer in use.

## [Images](/images/)
All images used in Jupyter Notebooks files and workshop notes should be in this directory.

## [reports](/reports/)
This is a directory that stores text files containing the latest date when the notes were compiled using a GitHub docker.

## Distribution
All to-be-distributed files should be uploaded to [this link](https://bit.ly/ustidpo) for distribution. Contact me (the owner) if this hasn't been done by the teaching day.
